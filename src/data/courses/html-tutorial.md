HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language used for creating and structuring web pages. It is the backbone of every web page you see on the internet. HTML provides a set of elements that define the structure and content of a webpage, such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, tables, and more.

HTML uses a simple syntax with tags to mark up the different elements on a page. These tags are enclosed in angle brackets, such as `<tag>. Each HTML tag serves a specific purpose and tells the web browser how to render and display the content. For example, the `<p> tag is used to define a paragraph, the `<h1> tag represents the main heading, and so on.

HTML documents are made up of a hierarchy of elements. The root element is `<html>, and it contains two main sections: the `<head> and the `<body>. The `<head> section provides metadata about the document, such as the title, character encoding, stylesheets, and scripts. The `<body> section contains the actual content that is displayed in the browser.
## Sample Code
Here's a basic HTML document structure:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>My First Web Page</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Welcome to My Web Page!</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

In the example above, we have an HTML document that starts with the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration, which tells the browser that it is an HTML5 document. The content is wrapped inside the `<html> tags, and the head and body sections are marked with the `<head> and `<body> tags, respectively. The `<title> tag is used to set the title of the webpage, and the `<h1> and `<p> tags define a heading and a paragraph of text.

HTML also allows you to include other elements within your document, such as images, links, lists, forms, and more. By combining these elements and using proper nesting, you can create complex web pages with interactive features.

As a beginner, it's essential to understand the basic HTML tags and their purpose. You can gradually learn more advanced concepts, such as CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling your HTML content and JavaScript for adding interactivity.

HTML is a versatile language that is constantly evolving. It's recommended to refer to the official documentation or online resources for the latest HTML specifications, best practices, and new features.

Now that you have a basic understanding of what HTML is, it's time to start exploring and experimenting with the language. Practice building simple web pages and gradually expand your knowledge. Happy coding!
