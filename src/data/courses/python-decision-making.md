# Python Decision Making

Decision making in programming involves executing different code blocks based on certain conditions. Python provides several constructs for decision making. Let's explore them:

## if Statement

The `if` statement is used to execute a block of code if a specified condition is true. Here's the syntax:

```python
if condition:
    # code block to be executed if the condition is true

Example:

```python
x = 5

if x > 0:
    print("x is positive")

## if-else Statement

The `if-else` statement is used to execute a block of code based on a condition. If the condition is true, a specific code block is executed; otherwise, another code block is executed. Here's the syntax:

```python
if condition:
    # code block to be executed if the condition is true
else:
    # code block to be executed if the condition is false

Example:

```
